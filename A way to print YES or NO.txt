
cout << "NO\0YES" + 3 * CONDITION << '\n';


It basically works as something like this:

const char *message = "NO\0YES";
const char *no_message = message + 0;
const char *yes_message = message + 3;
if (CONDITION)
  cout << yes_message << "\n";
else
  cout << no_message << "\n";

The message string contains two asciiz strings glued together (the "no" part starts at the offset 0 and the "yes" part starts at the offset 3). Then we can see that it's possible
to remove the "if" branch and just print message + 3 * CONDITION, which will evaluate to either message + 0 or message + 3 depending on the CONDITION variable. And finally it's
possible to get rid of the "message" variable altogether and just use the string literal directly.

Another similar single-liner trick is indexing an array of strings with two elements:

cout << (const char *[]){"NO\n", "YES\n"}[CONDITION];
